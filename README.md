# MLDawn-Projects
This repository contains projects defined in the blog posts by www.mldawn.com. The codes are heavily commented so one should not have difficulties understanding them. Below, for every scripts, we will provide an explanation and just so you know, the codes are not modular in any shape or form. In other words, by running a single scripts about, say, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), you will see all the outputs. This is not good coding practice, however, makes understanding and following the steps easier. Beloq are the scripts and the corresponding explanations:

## Understanding SGD.py
In order to understand this scripts even better, I suggest you follow the corresponding blog post at: https://www.mldawn.com/sgd/ . This script creates a hypothetical loss function for the outputs of a simple model that has only 1 learnable parameter, w_0. Then the scripts shows you a 3D and 2D visualizations of the loss surface. Next, for a given initial value of our learable parameter, w_0, the gradient vectors are computed on multiple loss surfaces given each each input data. This shows you how the loss surface can change given the input data! Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is then used to tune the value of w_0, and find the global minimum of the loss surface. The generated animation in the end, can make this exciting journey even more interesting.
